 *
 * Queries
 * --------
 *  _id: Generated by mongo, used as the URL to access it (/query/_id)
 *  regions: Array referencing regions._id that were a part of this query
 *  createdDate: Date the query was created
 *  filters: Array of filters to perform on junctions. Each filter has the format:
 *      {   "filter" : "junctions.xxx",
 *          "op" : "some_mongo_operator",
 *          "val" : some_value  }
 *
 *  Regions
 *  --------
 *  _id: Lower case and trimmed ID of the region used in the Snaptron query. E.G: "cd99", "ch6:1-1000"
 *  loadedDate: Date when this was loaded. null if never loaded (or failed to load)
 *  junctions: Array of junctions._id
 *  metadata: Array of {key:"someKey", value:"someValue"} metadata elements returned by Snaptron
 *
 *  Junctions
 *  ---------
 *  _id: Value of snaptron_id returned by Snaptron
 *  ** The rest of the fields are generated by Snaptron's response. The following are assumed to exist**
 *  samples_count
 *  coverage_sum
 *  coverage_avg
 *  coverage_median
 *  start
 *  stop
 *  length
